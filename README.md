Estimation can be performed manually or with the help of an estimation software package like Construc Estimte, Costar, or KnowledgePLAN - there are over 50 available on the market.
The numbers used to calculate these estimates can come from several sources.
There are two basic ways to estimate the time required to build a system.
Once a project manager has a general idea of the size and approximate schedule for the project, he or she creates a work plan, which is a dynamic schedule that records and keeps track of all of tasks.
To create a work plan, the project manager identifies the tasks that need to be accomplished and determines how long each one will take. 
Then the tasks are organized within a work breakdown structure.
A project manager can take the methodology, select the steps and deliverables that apply to the current project, and add them to the work plan.
If a project manager prefers to begin from scratch, he or she can use a structured, top-down approach whereby high-level tasks are defined first.
A list of tasks hierarchially numbered in this way is called a work breakdown structure.
The project work plan is the mechanism used to manage the tasks that are listed in the work breakdown structure.
Basically, the work plan is a table that lists all of the tasks in the work breakdown structure.
Staffing the project includes determining how many people should be assigned to the project, matching people's skills with the needs of the project, motivating them to meet the project's objectives.
160. The first step of staffing is determining the average number of staff needed for the project.
Hierarchical databases cannot efficiently represent many-to-many realationships or nonhierarchical associations - a major drawback - so network databses were developed to address this limitation.
Both kinds of legacy systems can handle data quite efficiently, but they require a great deal of programming effort.
As hardware costs dropped and people costs skyrocketed, these solutions became much less cost effective.
Potential adopters may want to adopt the change, but unless they are capable of adopting it, they won't. 
Every new system requires new skills, either because the basic work processes have changed.
Both of these approaches are controversial and are ususally considered only in the case of BPR when the new skills needed are likely to be the most different the set of skills of the current staff. 
What training should you provide to the system users?
The training should cover all the capabilities of the new system, so that users uncderstnd what each module does, right?
One source of guidance for designing training materials is the use cases and use scnearios. 
The most commonly used approach is classroom training. 
A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appear to the users of the system as a single computer.
The computing power of a CPU is proportional to the square of its price. 
Various inerconnection networks have been proposed and built, but all have property that each CPU has direct and exclusive access to its own, private memory.
Although the hardware is important, the software is even more important. 
Operating systems cannot be put into nice, neat pigeonholes like hardware.
In OSI model, there are not two layers, but seven.
The physical layer is connected with transmitting the 0s and 1s. 
The physical layer just sends bits. 
The payload type field distinguishes data cells from control cells, and further identifies several kinds of control cells.
A different switch design copies the cell into a queue associated with the output buffer and lets it wait there, instead of keeping it in the input buffer. 
The idea behind client-server model is to structure the operating system as a group of cooperating processes, called servers, that offers services to the users, called client.
The second approach is to require the kernel on the receiving machine to send an acknowledgement back to the kernel on the sending machine.
Although the reply functions as an acknowledgement for the request, there is no acknowledgement for the reply.
The sequence of the instructions that is executed on every RPC is called the critical path.
It starts when the client calls the client stub, proceeds through the trap to the kernel, the message transmission.
When it gets control, the kernel switches context, saving the CPU registers and memory map.
One hardware feature that gently helps eliminate unnecessary copying is scatter-gather.
If the buffers are aligned so that the header is at the end of one page and the data are at the start of the next.
One approach to avoiding the client-client interface we just saw is to make the entire pipeline read driven.
While ad-hoc solutions can be found, it should be clear that the client-server model inherent in RPC is not a good fit to this kind of communication pattern.
A synchronous system is one in which events happen strictly sequentially with each event taking essentially zero time to complete.
A loosely synchronous system is, in which events ake a finite amount of time but all events appear in the same order.
A virtually synchronous system, one in which the ordering constraint has been relaxed, but in such a way that under carefully selected circumstances, it does not matter.
The centralized algorithm kept all the information at a single site.
Threads were invented to allow parallelism to be combined with sequential execution and blocking system calls.

Plaintext is the origial message or data that is fed into the algorithm as input.
The encryption algorithm performs various substitutions and transformations on the plaintext.
This is the scrambled message produced as output. 
Decryption algorithm is essentially the encryption algorithm run in reverse.
The type of operations used for transforming plaintext to ciphertext.
An encryption scheme is computationally secure if the ciphertext generated by the scheme meets one or both of the criterias.
An algorithm that is used to produce an open-ended sequence of bits is referred to as a Pseudorandom number generator.
A Pseudorandom Function is used to produce a Pseudorandom string of bits of some fixed length.
The output of the generator, also called a keystream, is combined one byte at a time with the plaintext stream using the bitwise exclusive-OR.
An alternative to the message authentication code is the one-way hash code.
encryption software is quite slow.
The CCM mode of operation, defined in NIST SP 800-38C, is referred to as an authenticated encryption method.
However, both because unworkable and impractical legislation must be changed, and also because it does make political sense to fetter the discretion of any individual to make important appointments (whilst ensuring the primary role of an elected Executive as compared to other individuals or bodies without commensurate authority from the people), it would make sense following the General Election to review the 17th Amendment as soon as possible and introduce some sanity.
